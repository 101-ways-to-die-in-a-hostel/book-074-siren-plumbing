# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Hostel Nereid
**Type:** Budget / Historic
**Star Rating:** 3.2 on Hostelworld (complaints about "weird noises")
**Price Range:** 15-30 EUR per night

### History
Built in the 1970s on a site that has been occupied for over 2,000 years. The building sits over a Roman cistern from the 2nd century CE, which itself was built over a Greek structure from the 5th century BCE. Local legend says a siren was trapped here when the original temple was built - a punishment for luring sailors to their deaths. The hostel owners bought it cheap in 2005 and have never successfully updated the plumbing.

### Architecture
- **Style:** 1970s concrete over ancient foundations
- **Floors:** 4 (plus basement that's "off-limits")
- **Total beds:** 64
- **Notable features:** Ancient columns visible in the basement, pipes that sing, a well that was sealed in 1952 and never reopened

### Layout

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The Roman cistern, accessible through tunnels beneath the hostel. A circular chamber 50 feet in diameter, vaulted ceiling with a crack that lets in moonlight. The water is 4 feet deep at the edges, deeper in the center where the siren waits. The walls are ancient brick, covered in mineral deposits. Human bones litter the bottom, visible in the clear patches of water. The acoustics are perfect - her voice resonates and multiplies.

## The City

**City:** Athens
**Country:** Greece
**Population:** ~3.2 million metro area
**Known for:** The Acropolis, ancient history, birthplace of democracy, Greek mythology come to life

### Geography
- **Climate:** Mediterranean, hot dry summers, mild winters
- **Terrain:** Urban sprawl over ancient ruins, hills with temple views
- **Weather during story:** Early autumn, still warm, occasional thunderstorms

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Greek, English widely spoken
- **Religion(s):** Greek Orthodox majority
- **Customs relevant to story:** Greek mythology is cultural heritage, not believed literally. But some old superstitions persist - sailors still leave offerings, just in case.

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Very high - Athens is a major backpacker hub
- **Type of tourists:** History buffs, island hoppers using Athens as a base, Euro-trippers
- **Danger level:** Safe (per guidebooks - petty crime in tourist areas)

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Church bells, traffic, vendors, the chaos of a Mediterranean city waking
- Afternoon: Tour groups at nearby sites, coffee shops, heated debates
- Night: Music from tavernas, motorbikes, and in the hostel - the pipes
- Unique sounds: The pipes sing at night. Management blames "water pressure." It's been blamed on water pressure since 1976.

### Smells
- Hostel: Old building, coffee from the kitchen, pipe moisture
- Street: Souvlaki, diesel, jasmine in courtyards
- Specific to death location: Ancient water, mineral and strange. Something floral that shouldn't be there.

### Textures
- Surfaces: Concrete, tile, ancient stone where the old building shows through
- Climate feel: Dry heat in summer, humid in lower levels

### Tastes
- Local food: Souvlaki, moussaka, fresh fish, ouzo
- Hostel offerings: Basic breakfast, coffee all day, the bar sells cheap wine

### Visual Details
- Colors: White walls, blue accents, ochre from the ancient stones
- Light quality: Harsh Mediterranean sun above, fluorescent inside, darkness below
- Distinctive visuals: That painting of the siren in the common room. Guests always stop and stare.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Yiorgos Dimitriou
**Description:** 50s, chain smoker, inherited the hostel from his uncle. Has heard the singing. Refuses to discuss it.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver who can't explain why. Just tells guests not to go in the basement.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria | Been cleaning here 30 years, never goes below ground floor |
| Night desk | Kostas (philosophy student) | Knows the mythology, tries to warn people, no one listens |
| Maintenance | Stavros | Won't fix the basement hatch lock, says it's "not worth it" |
| Bar | Various | High turnover - no one lasts more than a few months |

### Staff Knowledge
Yiorgos knows something is wrong. Maria has heard the singing but pretends she hasn't. Kostas has researched the history and suspects the truth. Stavros' father told him never to go below, and he never has.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Chaotic and friendly. Backpackers planning Acropolis visits, comparing island ferry options. The singing isn't audible during the day - too much background noise.

### Night Vibe
Quieter. The common room empties around midnight. That's when guests start hearing things from the pipes. Most assume it's auditory pareidolia. Most are right. Some hear their names.

### Guest Demographics
Budget travelers, student backpackers, island hoppers, a surprising number of musicians drawn by the hostel's "unique acoustics."

### Reputation
Reviews are oddly polarized. Most say it's fine. Some rave about the "atmosphere." A handful mention bad dreams and singing pipes. One review from 2019 just says "don't go in the basement" with no further explanation. The reviewer's profile is now inactive.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
- Metro to Monastiraki, 10-minute walk through old streets
- Easy to miss - the entrance is down an alley with a small sign

### Check-in Process
Standard, except guests sign a form that includes "the hostel is not liable for disturbances caused by the plumbing system." No one reads it.

### Rules
- No accessing the basement
- Report unusual sounds to reception (no one ever does, or if they do, it's too late)
- Quiet hours after 11 PM (though the pipes don't respect this)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: decent, doesn't work in basement)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers
- [x] Laundry (in the basement, rarely used)
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar (cheap wine, local beer)
- [x] Rooftop (view of the Acropolis)
- [x] Tours offered (standard Athens walking tours)
- [x] Other: "Acoustic courtyard" where musicians play

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Athens geography and culture should be accurate
- Real Roman cisterns exist beneath Athens
- Greek mythology of sirens is well-documented
- Plumbing acoustics phenomena is real

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Greek mythology treated as legitimate cultural heritage
- Modern Greeks portrayed as sophisticated, not superstitious
- The siren is from ancient mythology, not modern Greek belief

### Sources
- Archaeological surveys of Athens underground
- Greek mythology academic sources
- Backpacker guides to Athens
- Plumbing engineering research on acoustic phenomena
