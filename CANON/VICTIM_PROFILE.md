## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in Edinburgh, only child of divorced parents who both moved on quickly. Raised himself on music - taught himself guitar, piano, wrote his first song at 12 about being invisible. Brief stint at university for music, dropped out when he realized the academy was killing his creativity. Has been traveling for three years, busking his way across Europe, writing songs about places and people who briefly touch his life.

### Why They Travel
Seeking inspiration. Seeking "her" - the imaginary woman who will understand him completely. Running from the fear that Edinburgh was right about him, that he's just another mediocre dreamer.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Heard from another busker that Athens has good acoustics near the ancient sites. Booked the cheapest hostel he could find - "Hostel Nereid" - because the name sounded like a song.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "haunting," "soul," "resonance," "meant to be," "beautiful"
- Avoids words like: "practical," "realistic," "hobby"
- Catchphrases: "Music finds you when you're ready," "There's a song in everything," "She's out there somewhere"

### Speech Pattern
- Speaks softly, measured, like he's always composing lyrics
- Lots of pauses
- Scottish accent softened by years of travel
- Quotes song lyrics in conversation

### Internal Monologue Style
Poetic, melancholic, always searching for meaning. Hears everything as potential music. Narrates his own life like a tragic ballad.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** SoundCloud (for music), Instagram (for aesthetic travel shots)
- **Follower count:** 2,300 on SoundCloud, 4,500 on Instagram
- **Posting style:** Moody black and white photos, snippets of songs recorded in beautiful locations
- **Last post before death:** A video of him playing guitar at sunset with the Parthenon in the background, caption: "Athens understands melancholy. New song coming about the voice I can't get out of my head."

### Online vs Reality
Curates an image of romantic wanderer when really he's cripplingly lonely. Posts about being at peace with solitude while desperately wishing someone would reach out. His "artistic suffering" is just regular suffering with better lighting.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother remarried, rarely calls
- Father somewhere in Aberdeen, sends money occasionally out of guilt
- No siblings

### Friends
- Other travelers who briefly walk alongside him then move on
- No one he's kept in touch with longer than a month

### Romantic
- Serial romantic who falls hard and fast
- Just ended things with a French girl who said he was "too much"

### At the Hostel
- Immediately notices the beautiful receptionist who doesn't notice him
- Bonds briefly with a Greek philosophy student who warns him about the pipes
- Plays guitar in the common room to lukewarm reception

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 4 AM to the voice in the pipes - she's singing something that sounds like his name. Records it on his phone but the recording is just static. Spends the morning distracted, certain tonight is the night he'll find her.

### Their Last Normal Moment
A German backpacker compliments his guitar playing. For a moment, he considers asking her to dinner instead of going pipe-hunting. Then he hears the voice again, and the German girl seems very far away.

### Final Thoughts
*She's real. She's beautiful. She's been waiting for me. I always knew there was someone. I always knew I was meant for something like this. The water is so cold but her arms are so warm and I can hear her song inside my head and this is it, this is the love I've been--*

### Last Words
"I knew you were real..." (whispered as he walks into her embrace)
